The Gandiva Expression Compiler
===============================

Gandiva is an expression compiler that uses `LLVM`_ to generate efficient native
code for projections and filters on Arrow record batches.

Using Gandiva involves three steps. First, you use the :py:class:`TreeExprBuilder` to
build a condition to filter on or a set of expressions to project rows. The builder provides
a library of functions that can be composed into complex expressions. Second,
you create a :py:class:`Filter` or :py:class:`Projector` from the expression. This step
compiles your expression into efficient native code. Finally, you use the filter or
projector you created to operate on Arrow record batches.

   As present, Gandiva is only built on PyArrow Conda distributions, not PyPI wheels.


Building Gandiva Expressions
----------------------------

Gandiva expressions are built with :py:class:`TreeExprBuilder`. For example,
to express ``2 < x < 3``:

.. code-block:: python

  import pyarrow as pa
  from pyarrow.gandiva import TreeExprBuilder

  builder = TreeExprBuilder()

  field_x = builder.make_field(pa.field('x', pa.float64()))
  scalar_2 = builder.make_literal(2.0, pa.float64())
  scalar_3 = builder.make_literal(3.0, pa.float64())

  expr = builder.make_and([
      builder.make_function('greater_than', [field_x, scalar_2], pa.bool_()),
      builder.make_function('less_than', [field_x, scalar_3], pa.bool_())
  ])

Each of the builder methods returns a new :py:class:`Node` in the expression
tree. This includes:

- :py:meth:`TreeExprBuilder.make_field` creates a field node: a reference to a
  column in the record batches. The type must match the type of the array in
  that column.

- :py:meth:`TreeExprBuilder.make_literal` creates a literal node: a literal value
  hardcoded.

- :py:meth:`TreeExprBuilder.make_function` creates a function node, which may
  take other nodes as arguments.
  :ref:`See available functions (C++ documentation) <gandiva-function-list>`.

- :py:meth:`TreeExprBuilder.make_if`, :py:meth:`TreeExprBuilder.make_and`, and
  :py:meth:`TreeExprBuilder.make_or` create new nodes based on if-else, boolean
  "and", and boolean "or" logic. (For "not", use the ``not(bool)`` function in
  ``make_function``.)


Executing Filter Expressions
----------------------------

To create a filter, you can convert a boolean expression node into a :py:class:`Condition`,
and instantiate the Gandiva filter using :py:func:`make_filter`. When creating the filter
instance, the expression is converted into LLVM IR and optimized, allowing it to
be reused for multiple record batches.

.. code-block:: python

  import pyarrow as pa
  from pyarrow.gandiva import TreeExprBuilder, make_filter

  builder = TreeExprBuilder()

  field_x = builder.make_field(pa.field('x', pa.float64()))
  scalar_2 = builder.make_literal(2.0, pa.float64())
  expr = builder.make_function('greater_than', [field_x, scalar_2], pa.bool_())

  condition = builder.make_condition(expr)

  record_batch = pa.record_batch([pa.array([1.0, 3.0], pa.float64())], ['x'])
  filter_executor = make_filter(record_batch.schema, condition)

The :py:meth:`Filter.evaluate` method runs the filter on a record batch. It
returns a :py:class:`SelectionVector`, which contains the indices of the
matching rows. This can either be used later when projecting rows with
:py:meth:`Projector.evaluate` or can be used to immediately filter the record
batch by converting into an Arrow array with :py:meth:`SelectionVector.to_array`
and using with the :py:meth:`pyarrow.RecordBatch.take` method.

.. code-block:: python

  selection_vector = filter_executor.evaluate(record_batch, pa.default_memory_pool())
  result = record_batch.take(selection_vector.to_array())


Executing Projection Expressions
--------------------------------

To create a :py:class:`Projector`, convert nodes into expressions using
:py:meth:`TreeExprBuilder.make_expression` and then pass that list into the
:py:func:`make_projector` function. For example, to project a record batch
with a float ``x`` into one with ``x`` and ``log(x)``:

.. code-block:: python

  import pyarrow as pa
  from pyarrow.gandiva import TreeExprBuilder, make_projector

  builder = TreeExprBuilder()

  field_x = builder.make_field(pa.field('x', pa.float64()))
  log_x = builder.make_function('log', [field_x], pa.float64())

  expressions = [
    builder.make_expression(field_x, pa.field('x', pa.float64())),
    builder.make_expression(log_x, pa.field('log_x', pa.float64()))
  ]

  record_batch = pa.record_batch([pa.array([1.0, 3.0], pa.float64())], ['x'])
  projector = make_projector(record_batch.schema, expressions, pa.default_memory_pool())

  result = projector.evaluate(record_batch)
